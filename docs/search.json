    "text": "Kernel machine learning 101\nTraining a kernel machine learning (ML) model is equivalent to solving the set of linear equations \\[{\\bf O} = \\hat{K}{\\bf \\alpha},\\] where the kernel function \\(K_{ij} = K({\\bf Q}_i, {\\bf Q}_j) = {\\rm Cov}(O_i, O_j)\\) measures the similarity between samples \\({\\bf Q}_i\\) and \\({\\bf Q}_j\\) (via the covariance function), and \\({\\bf \\alpha}\\) is the (unknown) vector of weight coefficients. Because of the linearity of the equation, we can invert–only if we also regularize–the problem at hand \\[\n\\alpha = (\\hat K + \\lambda \\mathbb{1})^{-1}{\\bf O},\n\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) implements Tikhonov regularization and \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is the identity matrix. Both \\(\\hat K\\) and \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) are \\(N \\times N\\) matrices, while \\(\\alpha\\) and \\({\\bf O}\\) are both vectors of length \\(N\\). Here \\(N\\) corresponds to the number of training samples. Determination of the coefficients \\({\\bf \\alpha}\\) corresponds to training the ML model.\nOnce trained, we can use it to predict new samples!

(1) takes on a particularly intuitive form: it is a linear expansion of kernel evaluations between each one of the \\(N\\) training points against the new configuration \\({\\bf Q}^*\\). Though it’s linear, this expression is typically far more expressive than a straight-up linear regression because of the so-called kernel trick: the kernel function gathers similarities in a high-dimensional (and implicit!) Hilbert space."

    "section": "Rotation",
    "text": "Rotation\nLet’s start with rotations. There are two types of symmetries: invariance and covariance.\n\nInvariance\nInvariance means that the target observable does not depend on the orientation of the sample. Intuitively, the net charge of a molecule (in vacuum) does not depend on its orientation. Making our ML model invariant to rotations simply means ignoring rotational degrees of freedom in the representation. For instance, working with internal coordinates (e.g., pairwise distances) will do just that.\n\n\nCovariance\nCovariance is a bit more interesting. Compared to invariance, now the observable will rotate together with the input sample. For instance, the dipole moment of a molecule rotates with the molecule itself.\nThere are two main routes that lead to covariance ML Models:\n\nPreprocess all samples to rotate them in an (arbitrary but consistent) local axis system; train and predict in that local frame; Rotate back in the global frame;\nPick a kernel that correctly orients its prediction based on the input sample\n\nRoute 1 is relatively easy to implement, and can be a good strategy for small molecules. For larger structures it may turn out challenging to define a local axis system.\nLet’s dive into route 2.\nFirst of all, “pick a kernel” means that among the very large number of kernels that one could choose, one / a few / some may have interesting mathematical properties. To be more precise, we’re looking for kernels that know a bit about geometry, and in fact obey the SO(3) rotation group—the group of rotations in 3D space. Because of the 3 dimensions, we will seek a matrix-valued kernel, i.e., one entry in the kernel matrix between any two samples will be of shape \\(3 \\times 3\\).\nFor simplicity we will focus on two-body interactions. The representation for sample \\(i\\) will be \\({\\bf q}_i = {\\bf r}_i\\), where \\({\\bf r}\\) is the interparticle vector.\nLet’s first define a base (scalar) Gaussian kernel, \\[\nk_{\\rm b}({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{({\\bf r}_m - {\\bf r}_l)^2}{2\\sigma ^2} \\right),\n\\] which only picks up distance information between the two samples.\nConstructing a covariant matrix-valued kernel can be obtained by integrating \\(k_{\\rm b}\\) over all rotation matrices, i.e., summing over all actions of the rotation group [Mehta] \\[\n\\hat \\kappa_{\\rm c}({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l) =\n\\int {\\rm d} \\hat{\\mathcal{R}} \\, \\hat{\\mathcal{R}} k_{\\rm b} ({\\bf q}_m, \\hat{\\mathcal{R}}{\\bf q}_l),\n\\] note how the rotation matrix is applied onto one of the two samples of the kernel function. An insightful paper by [Glielmo et al.] offered an analytical solution for pairs: \\[\n\\hat \\kappa_{\\rm c}({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l) =\n{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha_{ml}}\n\\left( \\frac{\\cosh \\gamma_{ml}}{\\gamma_{ml}} - \\frac{\\sinh \\gamma_{ml}}{\\gamma_{ml}^2} \\right)\n\\hat{{\\bf r}}_m \\hat{{\\bf r}}_l^{\\rm T},\n\\tag{2}\n\\] where \\(\\alpha_{ml} = r_m^2 + r_l^2 / 4\\sigma^2\\), \\(\\gamma_{ml} = r_mr_l/2\\sigma^2\\), and \\(\\hat{{\\bf r}}_m = {\\bf r}_m / r_m\\). What’s important in Eq. (2) is the right-most part of the RHS: the tensor product between the pairwise vectors is solely responsible for the covariance of \\(\\hat \\kappa_{\\rm c}({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l)\\)."

    "section": "Energy conservation",
    "text": "Energy conservation\nLet’s say we’re learning a force field. Energy conservation can take several forms, including:\n\nCurl of the force is zero: \\(\\nabla \\times {\\bf F} = 0\\)\nForce derives from a potential: \\({\\bf F} = -\\nabla E\\)\n\nLet’s select/construct a kernel that implements energy conservation! (See, among others, these important papers: [Macedo & Castro], [Chmiela et al.], [Bartok & Csanyi]). \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat\\kappa_{\\rm h}({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l)\n&= {\\rm Cov}\\left( \\frac{\\partial E({\\bf q}_m)}{\\partial {\\bf r}_m}, \\frac{\\partial E({\\bf q}_l)}{\\partial {\\bf r}_l} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\frac{\\partial^2 k({\\bf q}_m, {\\bf q}_l)}{\\partial q_{m, \\alpha}\\partial q_{l, \\beta}}\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial q_{m,\\alpha}}{\\partial{\\bf r}_m} \\right)\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial q_{l,\\beta}}{\\partial{\\bf r}_l} \\right)^{\\rm T},\n\\end{align}\n\\] which is sometimes called the Hesian kernal, due to the first term of the RHS. While you can try to work out the partial derivatives for a given kernel (e.g., the abovementioned Gaussian kernel), what’s important here again are the other terms: We recognize once again a tensor product! For pairwise interactions, covariance and energy conservation go hand in hand, and lead to matrix-valued kernels with similar characteristics."

The autonomous motion is due to imbalanced transitions resulting from exothermic catalytic reactions, and the spatial asymmetry from the track.

    "section": "",
    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nABSTRACT Assessing the permeation rate of drug-like molecules across a lipid membrane is of paramount importance for pharmaceutical applications. While the Meyer-Overton rule relates the permeability coefficient to a few thermodynamic properties, its accuracy is limited by the homogeneity assumption. In this work, we extract an analogous relation for the permeation of a small solute through a lipid bilayer. This is obtained by systematically screening a subset of chemical space by means of high-throughput coarse-grained simulations, and relying on the accurate inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model (ISDM). We connect the permeability coefficient of a compound to two molecular descriptors: partitioning free-energy and acid dissociation constant. In the ISDM the permeability is a functional of the potential of mean force. We discuss how – and when – combining together these profiles for a large variety of compounds can result in a smooth dependence of the permeability on the molecular descriptors. We focus on acidic molecules: for weak acids, the permeability largely depends on the main free-energy differences of the problem, which directly link to our molecular descriptors. For strong acids, the multivalued nature of the permeability requires to introduce a third variable, characterising the amphiphilicity of the small molecule.

However, the parametrization of accurate, reliable, and consistent coarse-grained (CG) models for systems at interfaces remains a challenging endeavor. In the present work, we explore to what extent two independently developed solvent-free CG models of peptides and lipids–of different mapping schemes, parametrization methods, target functions, and validation criteria–can be combined by only tuning the cross-interactions. Our results show that the cross-parametrization can reproduce a number of structural properties of membrane peptides (for example, tilt and hydrophobic mismatch), in agreement with existing peptide-lipid CG force fields. We find encouraging results for two challenging biophysical problems: (i) membrane pore formation mediated by the cooperative action of several antimicrobial peptides, and (ii) the insertion and folding of the helix-forming peptide WALP23 in the membrane.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nThe results show that the cross-parametrization can reproduce a number of structural properties of membrane peptides, in agreement with existing peptide-lipid CG force fields, and finds encouraging results for two challenging biophysical problems.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Bereau_2014,\n    doi = {10.1063/1.4867465},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1063%2F1.4867465},\n    year = 2014,\n    month = {mar},\n    publisher = {{AIP} Publishing},\n    volume = {140},\n    number = {11},\n    author = {Tristan Bereau and Zun-Jing Wang and Markus Deserno},\n    title = {More than the sum of its parts: Coarse-grained peptide-lipid interactions from a simple cross-parametrization},\n    journal = {The Journal of Chemical Physics}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

This is achieved by relying on a physics-based coarse-grained model that reduces the size of chemical space, enabling a comprehensive exploration of this space with greatly reduced computational cost. We perform high-throughput coarse-grained (HTCG) simulations to derive a permeability surface in terms of two simple molecular descriptors—bulk partitioning free energy and pKa. The surface is constructed by exhaustively simulating all coarse-grained compounds that are representative of small organic molecules (ranging from 30 to 160 Da) in a high-throughput scheme. We provide results for acidic, basic, and zwitterionic compounds. Connecting back to the atomic resolution, the HTCG predictions for more than 500 000 compounds allow us to establish a clear connection between specific chemical groups and the resulting permeability coefficient, enabling for the first time an inverse design procedure. Our results have profound implications for drug synthesis: the predominance of commonly employed chemical moieties narrows down the range of permeabilities.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nThis work reduces a priori the size and diversity of chemical space to solve an analogous—but smoothed out—structure–property relationship problem, and establishes a clear connection between specific chemical groups and the resulting permeability coefficient, enabling for the first time an inverse design procedure.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Menichetti_2019,\n    doi = {10.1021/acscentsci.8b00718},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1021%2Facscentsci.8b00718},\n    year = 2019,\n    month = {jan},\n    publisher = {American Chemical Society ({ACS})},\n    volume = {5},\n    number = {2},\n    pages = {290--298},\n    author = {Roberto Menichetti and Kiran H.

Despite continued advancement of simulation methodology, model errors may lead to inconsistencies between simulated and reference (e.g., from experiments or higher-level simulations) observables. To bound the microscopic information generated by computer simulations within reference measurements, we propose a method that reweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with a set of coarse kinetic observables. The method employs the well-developed Markov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with long-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of time scales. To emphasize the robustness of the method, we consider two distinct coarse-grained models with significant kinetic inconsistencies. When applied to the simulated conformational dynamics of small peptides, the reweighting procedure systematically improves the time scale separation of the slowest processes. Additionally, constraining the forward and backward rates between metastable states leads to slight improvement of their relative stabilities and, thus, refined equilibrium properties of the resulting model.

The reduced molecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit inconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields—one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution of CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to improve the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models, which employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant force-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow kinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times between metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these states. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into a structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil transition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models understabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models that improve the ratio of forward/backward timescales by effectively hindering the sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nThis work relies on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields—one top-down and one bottom-up—in order to improve the description of kinetics.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Rudzinski_2016,\n    doi = {10.1140/epjst/e2016-60114-5},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2016-60114-5},\n    year = 2016,\n    month = {jul},\n    publisher = {Springer Science and Business Media {LLC}},\n    volume = {225},\n    number = {8-9},\n    pages = {1373--1389},\n    author = {J.F.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nCoarse-grained (CG) models are often parameterized to reproduce one-dimensional structural correlation functions of an atomically detailed model along the degrees of freedom governing each interaction potential. While cross correlations between these degrees of freedom inform the optimal set of interaction parameters, the correlations generated from the higher-resolution simulations are often too complex to act as an accurate proxy for the CG correlations. Instead, the most popular methods determine the interaction parameters iteratively while assuming that individual interactions are uncorrelated. While these iterative methods have been validated for a wide range of systems, they also have disadvantages when parameterizing models for multicomponent systems or when refining previously established models to better reproduce particular structural features. In this work, we propose two distinct approaches for the direct (i.e., noniterative) parameterization of a CG model by adjusting the high-resolution cross correlations of an atomistic model in order to more accurately reflect correlations that will be generated by the resulting CG model. The derived models more accurately describe the low-order structural features of the underlying AA model while necessarily generating inherently distinct cross correlations compared with the atomically detailed reference model. We demonstrate the proposed methods for a one-site-per-molecule representation of liquid water, where pairwise interactions are incapable of reproducing the true tetrahedral solvation structure.

The underlying processes are still poorly understood, in particular, how the hundreds of components are controlled. Cholesterol has been found to correlate with phospholipid saturation for reasons that remain unclear. To better understand the link between cell membrane regulation and chemical composition, we establish a computational framework based on chemical reaction networks, resulting in multiple semigrand canonical ensembles. By running computer simulations, we show that regulating the chemical potential of lipid species is sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed increase in acyl tail saturation with added cholesterol. Our model proposes a different picture of lipid regulation in which components can be regulated passively instead of actively. In this picture, phospholipid acyl tail composition naturally adapts to added molecules such as cholesterol or proteins. A comparison between regulated membranes with commonly studied ternary model membranes shows stark differences: for instance, correlation lengths and viscosities observed are independent of lipid chemical affinity.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nNone\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Girard_2020,\n    doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2020.07.024},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2020.07.024},\n    year = 2020,\n    month = {sep},\n    publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\n    volume = {119},\n    number = {5},\n    pages = {892--899},\n    author = {Martin Girard and Tristan Bereau},\n    title = {Regulating Lipid Composition Rationalizes Acyl Tail Saturation Homeostasis in Ectotherms},\n    journal = {Biophysical Journal}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

For the 1D infrared spectra, the frequency splitting between the two amide-I groups is 10 cm-1 from the PC, 13 cm-1 from the MTP, and 47 cm-1 from self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) simulations, compared with 25 cm-1 from experiment. The frequency trajectory required for the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) is determined from individual normal mode (INM) and full normal mode (FNM) analyses of the amide-I vibrations. The spectroscopy, time-zero magnitude of the FFCF C(t = 0), and the static component Δ02 from simulations using MTP and analysis based on FNM are all consistent with experiments for (Ala)3. Contrary to this, for the analysis excluding mode-mode coupling (INM), the FFCF decays to zero too rapidly and for simulations with a PC-based force field, the Δ02 is too small by a factor of two compared with experiments. Simulations with SCC-DFTB agree better with experiment for these observables than those from PC-based simulations. The conformational ensemble sampled from simulations using PCs is consistent with the literature (including PII, β, αR, and αL), whereas that covered by the MTP-based simulations is dominated by PII with some contributions from β and αR. This agrees with and confirms recently reported Bayesian-refined populations based on 1D infrared experiments.

This fidelity results from the tight link to a higher resolution reference, making the CG model chemically specific. Unfortunately, chemical specificity can be at odds with compound-screening strategies, which call for transferable parameterizations. Here, we present an approach to reconcile bottom-up, structure-preserving CG models with chemical transferability. We consider the bottom-up CG parameterization of 3441 C7O2 small-molecule isomers. Our approach combines atomic representations, unsupervised learning, and a large-scale extended-ensemble force-matching parameterization. We first identify a subset of 19 representative molecules, which maximally encode the local environment of all gas-phase conformers. Reference interactions between the 19 representative molecules were obtained from both homogeneous bulk liquids and various binary mixtures. An extended-ensemble parameterization over all 703 state points leads to a CG model that is both structure-based and chemically transferable. Remarkably, the resulting force field is on average more structurally accurate than single-state-point equivalents. Averaging over the extended ensemble acts as a mean-force regularizer, smoothing out both force and structural correlations that are overly specific to a single-state point. Our approach aims at transferability through a set of CG bead types that can be used to easily construct new molecules while retaining the benefits of a structure-based parameterization.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nNone\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Kanekal_2022,\n    doi = {10.1063/5.0104914},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1063%2F5.0104914},\n    year = 2022,\n    month = {sep},\n    publisher = {{AIP} Publishing},\n    volume = {157},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {104102},\n    author = {Kiran H.

The first measurements reported compositional asymmetry: phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine are mostly on the cytoplasmic leafet, while phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin are mostly on the exoplasmic leaflet. More recent experiments using lipidomics have evidenced the presence of saturation asymmetry between the two leaflets. A question that naturally arises is why such an asymmetry? To complicate matters, it is still largely unknown in which leaflet cholesterol lies. Here, we use chemical potentials to mimic flippase proteins responsible for maintenance of compositional asymmetry in silico. We show that saturation asymmetry naturally arises as a byproduct of phospholipid number asymmetry and sphingomyelin contents, thereby showing that some reported asymmetries may naturally result from others and do not necessarily require being externally driven. We also show that plasmalogen lipids’ tendency to be highly unsaturated is also natural.

Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data ‘findable and AI ready’ (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nTwo-state cooperativity is an important characteristic in protein folding. It is defined by a depletion of states that lie energetically between folded and unfolded conformations. There are different ways to test for two-state cooperativity; however, most of these approaches probe indirect proxies of this depletion. Generalized-ensemble computer simulations allow us to unambiguously identify this transition by a microcanonical analysis on the basis of the density of states. Here, we present a detailed characterization of several helical peptides obtained by coarse-grained simulations. The level of resolution of the coarse-grained model allowed to study realistic structures ranging from small α-helices to a de novo three-helix bundle without biasing the force field toward the native state of the protein. By linking thermodynamic and structural features, we are able to show that whereas short α-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states. The helix bundle exhibits signs of two-state cooperativity owing to favorable helix-helix interactions, as predicted from theoretical models. A detailed analysis of secondary and tertiary structure formation fits well into the framework of several folding mechanisms and confirms features that up to now have been observed only in lattice models.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nIt is shown that whereas short α-helices exhibit two-state cooperativity, the type of transition changes for longer chain lengths because the chain forms multiple helix nucleation sites, stabilizing a significant population of intermediate states.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Bereau_2011,\n    doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2011.03.056},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2011.03.056},\n    year = 2011,\n    month = {jun},\n    publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\n    volume = {100},\n    number = {11},\n    pages = {2764--2772},\n    author = {Tristan Bereau and Markus Deserno and Michael Bachmann},\n    title = {Structural Basis of Folding Cooperativity in Model Proteins: Insights from a Microcanonical Perspective},\n    journal = {Biophysical Journal}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nCoarse-grained molecular simulation models can provide significant insight into the complex behavior of protein systems, but suffer from an inherently distorted description of dynamical properties. We recently demonstrated that, for a heptapeptide of alanine residues, the structural and kinetic properties of a simulation model are linked in a rather simple way, given a certain level of physics present in the model. In this work, we extend these findings to a longer peptide, for which the representation of configuration space in terms of a full enumeration of sequences of helical/coil states along the peptide backbone is impractical. We verify the structural-kinetic relationships by scanning the parameter space of a simple native-biased model and then employ a distinct transferable model to validate and generalize the conclusions. Our results further demonstrate the validity of the previous findings, while clarifying the role of conformational entropy in the determination of the structural-kinetic relationships. More specifically, while the global, long timescale kinetic properties of a particular class of models with varying energetic parameters but approximately fixed conformational entropy are determined by the overarching structural features of the ensemble, a shift in these kinetic observables occurs for models with a distinct representation of steric interactions. At the same time, the relationship between structure and more local, faster kinetic properties is not affected by varying the conformational entropy of the model.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nNone\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Rudzinski_2018,\n    doi = {10.3390/computation6010021},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fcomputation6010021},\n    year = 2018,\n    month = {feb},\n    publisher = {{MDPI} {AG}},\n    volume = {6},\n    number = {1},\n    pages = {21},\n    author = {Joseph Rudzinski and Tristan Bereau},\n    title = {The Role of Conformational Entropy in the Determination of Structural-Kinetic Relationships for Helix-Coil Transitions},\n    journal = {Computation}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

We first perform importance sampling by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme across compounds. We then train a machine learning (ML) model on the sampled data to expand the region of chemical space probed. Our boosting procedure enhances the number of compounds by a factor 2 to 10, enabled by the ML model’s coarse-grained representation, which both simplifies the structure-property relationship and reduces the size of chemical space. The ML model correctly recovers linear relationships between transfer free energies. These linear relationships correspond to features that are global to the dataset, marking the region of chemical space up to which predictions are reliable; this is a more robust alternative to the predictive variance.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nProtein structure formation in the membrane highlights a grand challenge of sampling in computer simulations, because kinetic traps and slow dynamics make it difficult to find the native state. Exploiting increased fluctuations at higher temperatures can help overcome free-energy barriers, provided the membrane’s structure remains stable. In this work, we apply Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics, where we only tune the backbone hydrogen-bond strength to help reduce the propensity of long-lived misfolded states. Using a recently developed coarse-grained model, we illustrate the robustness of the method by folding different WALP transmembrane helical peptides starting from stretched, unstructured conformations. We show the efficiency of the method by comparing to simulations without enhanced sampling, achieving folding in one example after significantly longer simulation times. Analysis of the bilayer structure during folding provides insight into the local membrane deformation during helix formation as a function of chain length (from 16 to 23 residues). Finally, we apply our method to fold the 50-residue-long major pVIII coat protein (fd coat) of the filamentous fd bacteriophage.

We are particularly invested in using multiscale modeling to explore chemical compound space. The group develops methodologies to accelerate compound-space exploration by means of high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Transferable coarse-grained models have the capability to reduce the size of chemical space—a property we leverage to more easily navigate the thermodynamic properties of a large subset of chemical compounds. Coarse-graining also eases the identification of structure–property relationships and design rules for molecular discovery. Other activities include method development of coarse-grained models; machine learning for soft matter; non-equilibrium dynamical reweighting; force-field development; polymer, protein, and phospholipid membrane simulations.\n\n\nCoarse-graining for molecular discovery\n\n\n\n\n\nActive learning of molecular probes selective to cardiolipin\n\n\nCoarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations are used for molecular discovery of small molecule probes that specifically bind to cardiolipin. We combine rigorous free-energy calculations, selectivity prediction inside a low-dimensional chemical-space embedding, and Bayesian optimization to identify physicochemical design rules. Said design rules are used to further filter a chemical vendor database. Out of 20 compounds tested, we identify three compounds selective in vitro and even one in vivo.\n\ndisplayTable(\n    papers.filter(function(p) {\n        return (\n            p.authors.map(a =&gt; a.full_name).includes(\"Bernadette Mohr\")\n        )\n    })\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning for soft-matter materials\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficient learning of coarse-grained molecular simulations\n\n\nWe explore the links between machine learning (ML) and multiscale molecular modeling.

In this work, we propose an alternative to the computationally expensive MTP molecular dynamics simulations by running a simple PC simulation and later reevaluate-“score’’-all energies using the more detailed MTP force field. The method, which relies on the assumption that the PC and MTP force fields generate closely related phase spaces, is accomplished by enforcing identical sets of monopoles between the two force fields-effectively highlighting the higher MTP terms as a correction to the PC approximation. We first detail our consistent parametrization of the electrostatics and van der Waals interactions for the two force fields. We then validate the method by comparing the accuracy of protein-ligand binding free energies from both PC and MTP-scored representations with experimentally determined binding constants obtained by us. Specifically, we study the binding of several arylsulfonamide ligands to human carbonic anhydrase II. We find that both representations yield an accuracy of 1 kcal/mol with respect to experiment. Finally, we apply the method to rank the energetic contributions of individual atomic MTP coefficients for molecules solvated in water.

    "section": "",
    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nThe systematic exploration of chemical compound space holds many promises toward structure-function relationships and material design. In the context of computer simulations, progress is hampered by both the sheer number of compounds and the efforts associated with parametrizing a force field for every new molecule. A coarse-grained (CG) representation provides not only a reduced phase space but also a smaller number of compounds, due to the redundancy of CG representations mapping to the same structure. Though many CG models require the explicit force-field parametrization of a molecule with all others, others assume transferability by means of mixing rules, such as the Martini force field. To alleviate the burden associated with tedious parametrizations for each new compound, the present work aims at automating the mapping and parametrization of common small organic molecules for Martini. We test the method by analyzing the water/octanol partitioning of more than 650 neutral molecules, the hydration free energy of 354 others, and the free energies of hydration and solvation in octanol of another 69 compounds. Last, we compare with all-atom simulations the thermodynamics of insertion of four individual solute molecules in a phospholipid membrane.

    "section": "",
    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nA generic coarse-grained (CG) protein model is presented. The intermediate level of resolution (four beads per amino acid, implicit solvent) allows for accurate sampling of local conformations. It relies on simple interactions that emphasize structure, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity. Realistic alpha/beta content is achieved by including an effective nearest-neighbor dipolar interaction. Parameters are tuned to reproduce both local conformations and tertiary structures. The thermodynamics and kinetics of a three-helix bundle are studied. We check that the CG model is able to fold proteins with tertiary structures and amino acid sequences different from the one used for parameter tuning.

To do away with prior parametrization, we propose a combination of physics-based potentials with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across small neutral organic and biologically relevant molecules. ML models provide on-the-fly predictions for environment-dependent local atomic properties: electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant error reduction compared to previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions of H, C, N, and O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of intermolecular contributions-electrostatics, charge penetration, repulsion, induction/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other potentials, this model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are predicted from ML, leaving only eight global parameters-optimized once and for all across compounds. We validate IPML on various gas-phase dimers at and away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute errors between 0.4 and 0.7 kcal/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse datasets representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically relevant molecules. We further focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes-essential but challenging due to their directional nature-where datasets of DNA base pairs and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal/mol error.

Traditionally, new sequences are discovered either from screening large libraries or by creating derivatives of known active peptides. However, the discovery of de novo peptides, which are sequence-wise not related to any known active peptides, is limited by the difficulty to rationally predict structure-activity relationships because their activities typically have multi-scale and multi-parameter dependencies. Here, we used a small library of 163 peptides as a training set to predict de novo sequences for viral infectivity enhancement using a machine learning (ML) approach based on natural language processing. Specifically, we trained an ML model using continuous vector representations of the peptides, which were previously shown to retain relevant information embedded in the sequences. We used the trained ML model to sample the sequence space of peptides with 6 amino acids to identify promising candidates. These 6-mers were then further screened for charge and aggregation propensity. The resulting 16 new 6-mers were tested and found to be active with a 25% hit rate. Strikingly, these de novo sequences are the shortest active peptides for infectivity enhancement reported so far and show no sequence relation to the training set. Moreover, by screening the sequence space, we discovered the first hydrophobic peptide fibrils with a moderately negative surface charge that can enhance infectivity. Hence, this ML strategy is a time- and cost-efficient way for expanding the sequence space of short functional self-assembling peptides exemplified for therapeutic viral gene delivery.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nThese de novo sequences are the shortest active peptides for infectivity enhancement reported so far and show no sequence relation to the training set, and by screening the sequence space, are the first hydrophobic peptide fibrils with a moderately negative surface charge that can enhance infectivity.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Kaygisiz_2023,\n    doi = {10.1039/d3bm00412k},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1039%2Fd3bm00412k},\n    year = 2023,\n    publisher = {Royal Society of Chemistry ({RSC})},\n    author = {Kübra Kaygisiz and Arghya Dutta and Lena Rauch-Wirth and Christopher V.

We recently introduced a Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) approach for dynamical reweighting. Our approach mapped these trajectories to a Markovian description on the configurational coordinates and reweighted path probabilities as a function of external forces. Trajectory probabilities can be dynamically reweighted both from and to equilibrium or non-equilibrium steady states. As the system’s dimensionality increases, an exhaustive description of the microtrajectories becomes prohibitive-even with a Markovian assumption. Instead, we reduce the dimensionality of the configurational space to collective variables (CVs). Going from configurational to CV space, we define local entropy productions derived from configurationally averaged mean forces. The entropy production is shown to be a suitable constraint on MaxCal for non-equilibrium steady states expressed as a function of CVs. We test the reweighting procedure on two systems: a particle subject to a two-dimensional potential and a coarse-grained peptide.

The inner mitochondrial membrane contains the phospholipid cardiolipin, which has been demonstrated to act as a biomarker for a number of diverse pathologies. Small molecule dyes capable of selectively partitioning into cardiolipin membranes enable visualization and quantification of the cardiolipin content. Here we present a data-driven approach that combines a deep learning-enabled active learning workflow with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and alchemical free energy calculations to discover small organic compounds able to selectively permeate cardiolipin-containing membranes. By employing transferable coarse-grained models we efficiently navigate the all-atom design space corresponding to small organic molecules with molecular weight less than ≈500 Da. After direct simulation of only 0.42% of our coarse-grained search space we identify molecules with considerably increased levels of cardiolipin selectivity compared to a widely used cardiolipin probe 10-N-nonyl acridine orange. Our accumulated simulation data enables us to derive interpretable design rules linking coarse-grained structure to cardiolipin selectivity.

The hypothesis has attracted much attention while remaining controversial, with an underlying mechanism that remains elusive. One idea that supports rafts relies on the membrane lying near a critical point. Although supported by experimental evidence, holding a many-component membrane at criticality requires a delicate tuning of all components—a daunting task. Here, we propose a coherent framework to reconcile critical behavior and lipid regulation. Using a lattice model, we show that lipid regulation of a complex membrane, i.e., allowing composition to fluctuate based on relative chemical potentials, can lead to critical behavior. The results are robust against specific values of the chemical potentials. Instead of a conventional transition point, criticality is observed over a large temperature range. This surprising behavior arises from finite-size effects, causing nonequivalent time and space averages. The instantaneous lipid distribution effectively develops a translational symmetry, which we relate to long-wavelength Goldstone modes. The framework is robust and reproduces important experimental trends; membrane-demixing temperature closely follows cell-growth temperature. It also ensures criticality of fixed-composition extracts, such as giant plasma membrane vesicles. Our clear picture provides a strong argument in favor of the critical-membrane hypothesis, without the need for specific sensing mechanisms.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nA coherent framework to reconcile critical behavior and lipid regulation is proposed and it is shown that lipid regulation of a complex membrane, i.e., allowing composition to fluctuate based on relative chemical potentials, can lead to critical behavior.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Girard_2021,\n    doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2021.03.043},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2021.03.043},\n    year = 2021,\n    month = {jun},\n    publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\n    volume = {120},\n    number = {12},\n    pages = {2436--2443},\n    author = {Martin Girard and Tristan Bereau},\n    title = {Finite-size transitions in complex membranes},\n    journal = {Biophysical Journal}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

We consider the prediction of passive drug-membrane permeability coefficients. Beyond the widely recognized correlation with hydrophobicity, we additionally consider the functional relationship between passive permeation and acidity. To discover easily interpretable equations that explain the data well, we use the recently proposed sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), an artificial-intelligence technique that combines symbolic regression with compressed sensing. Our study is based on a large in silico dataset of 0.4 × 106 small molecules extracted from coarse-grained simulations. We rationalize the equation suggested by SISSO via an analysis of the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model in several asymptotic acidity regimes.

Our results are in line with previously observed changes in permeability, suggesting the distinction between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered permeation.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nSmall solutes have been shown to alter the lateral organization of cell membranes and reconstituted phospholipid bilayers; however, the mechanisms by which these changes happen are still largely unknown. Traditionally, both experiment and simulation studies have been restricted to testing only a few compounds at a time, failing to identify general molecular descriptors or chemical properties that would allow extrapolating beyond the subset of considered solutes. In this work, we probe the competing energetics of inserting a solute in different membrane environments by means of the potential of mean force. We show that these calculations can be used as a computationally efficient proxy to establish whether a solute will stabilize or destabilize domain phase separation. Combined with umbrella-sampling simulations and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to screen solutes across a wide range of chemistries and polarities. Our results indicate that for the system under consideration, preferential partitioning and therefore effectiveness in altering membrane phase separation are strictly linked to the location of insertion in the bilayer (i.e., midplane or interface). Our approach represents a fast and simple tool for obtaining structural and thermodynamic insight into the partitioning of small molecules between lipid domains and its relation to phase separation, ultimately providing a platform for identifying the key determinants of this process.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nNone\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Centi_2020,\n    doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2020.01.039},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2020.01.039},\n    year = 2020,\n    month = {mar},\n    publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\n    volume = {118},\n    number = {6},\n    pages = {1321--1332},\n    author = {Alessia Centi and Arghya Dutta and Sapun H.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nExtracting insight from the enormous quantity of data generated from molecular simulations requires the identification of a small number of collective variables whose corresponding low-dimensional free-energy landscape retains the essential features of the underlying system. Data-driven techniques provide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for extensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular, autoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally force an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of the essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the embedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the multi-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification of meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical intuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE), which encourages the separation of metastable states within the embedding. The GMVAE performs dimensionality reduction and clustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the inherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians required to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models, alanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating the enhanced clustering effect of the GMVAE prior compared to standard VAEs.

The significance of electrostatic interactions in RTILs results in long characteristic length- and timescales, and has motivated the development of a number of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models. In this study, we aim to better understand the connection between certain CG parameterization strategies and the dynamical properties and transferability of the resulting models. We systematically compare five CG models: a model largely parameterized from experimental thermodynamic observables; a refinement of this model to increase its structural accuracy; and three models that reproduce a given set of structural distribution functions by construction, with varying intramolecular parameterizations and reference temperatures. All five CG models display limited structural transferability over temperature, and also result in various effective dynamical speedup factors, relative to a reference atomistic model. On the other hand, the structure-based CG models tend to result in more consistent cation–anion relative diffusion than the thermodynamic-based models, for a single thermodynamic state point.

The use of a chemically transferable coarse-grained model enables different molecular fragments to map to the same bead type, significantly increasing screening efficiency. Here, we propose new criteria for the design of coarse-grained models allowing for the optimization of their chemical transferability and evaluate the Martini model within this framework. We further investigate the scope of this transferability by parameterizing three Martini-like models in which the number of bead types ranges from 5 to 16. These force fields are fully compatible with existing Martini environments because they are parameterized by interpolating the Martini interaction matrix. We then implement a Bayesian approach to determining which chemical groups are likely to be present on fragments corresponding to specific bead types for each model. We demonstrate that a level of accuracy comparable to Martini is obtained with a force field with fewer bead types, using the water/octanol partitioning free energy (ΔGW→Ol) as our metric for comparison. However, the advantage of including more bead types is a reduction of uncertainty when back-mapping these bead types to specific chemistries. Just as reducing the size of the coarse-grained particles leads to a finer mapping of conformational space, increasing the number of bead types yields a finer mapping of CCS. Finally, we note that, due to the large size of fragments mapping to a single Martini bead, a resolution limit arises when using ΔGW→Ol as the only descriptor when coarse-graining CCS.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nNew criteria for the design of coarse-grained models allowing for the optimization of their chemical transferability are proposed and the Martini model is evaluated within this framework.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Kanekal_2019,\n    doi = {10.1063/1.5119101},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1063%2F1.5119101},\n    year = 2019,\n    month = {oct},\n    publisher = {{AIP} Publishing},\n    volume = {151},\n    number = {16},\n    pages = {164106},\n    author = {Kiran H.

In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations.

When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models.

The WALP peptide, GWW(LA)n (L)WWA, is a common model helix to study the fundamentals of protein insertion and folding, as well as helix-helix association in the membrane. Its structural properties have been illuminated in a large number of experimental and simulation studies. In this combined coarse-grained and atomistic simulation study, we probe the thermodynamics of a single WALP peptide, focusing on both the insertion across the water-membrane interface, as well as folding in both water and a membrane. The potential of mean force characterizing the peptide’s insertion into the membrane shows qualitatively similar behavior across peptides and three force fields. However, the Martini force field exhibits a pronounced secondary minimum for an adsorbed interfacial state, which may even become the global minimum-in contrast to both atomistic simulations and the alternative PLUM force field. Even though the two coarse-grained models reproduce the free energy of insertion of individual amino acids side chains, they both underestimate its corresponding value for the full peptide (as compared with atomistic simulations), hinting at cooperative physics beyond the residue level.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nThe two-dimensional infrared spectrum of NMAH and NMAD in H2O and D2O is computed on the basis of force field parametrizations ranging from standard point charge (PC) to more elaborate multipolar (MTP) representations of the electrostatics. For the latter, the nonbonded parameters (MTP and van der Waals) were optimized to reproduce thermodynamic data. The frequency trajectory and frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) are determined from explicit frequency calculations on ∼10(6) snapshots without using a more traditional “mapping” approach. This allows us to both sample configurations and compute observables in a consistent fashion. In agreement with experiment, the FFCF shows one very rapid time scale (in the 50 fs range) followed by one or two longer time scales. In the case of three time scales, the intermediate one is ≈0.5 ps or shorter, whereas the longest time scale can extend up to 2 or 3 ps. All interaction models lead to three time scales in the FFCF when fitted to an empirical parametrized form. When two time scales are assumed-as is usually done in the analysis of experimental data-and the short time scale is fixed to the τ1 = 50-100 fs range, the correlation time τc from the simulations ranges from 0.7 to 1 ps, which agrees quite well with experimentally determined values. The major difference between MTP and PC models is the observation that the later decay times in the FFCF are longer for simulations with MTPs. Also, the amplitude of the FFCF is reduced when simulations are carried out with MTPs. Overall, however, PC-based models perform well compared to those based on MTPs for NMAD in D2O and can be recommended for such investigations in the context of peptide and protein simulations.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nPC-based models perform well compared to those based on MTPs for NMAD in D2O and can be recommended for such investigations in the context of peptide and protein simulations.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Cazade_2014,\n    doi = {10.1021/jp5011692},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp5011692},\n    year = 2014,\n    month = {apr},\n    publisher = {American Chemical Society ({ACS})},\n    volume = {118},\n    number = {28},\n    pages = {8135--8147},\n    author = {Pierre-Andr{\\'{e}} Cazade and Tristan Bereau and Markus Meuwly},\n    title = {Computational Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy without Maps: $\\less$i$\\greater$N$\\less$/i$\\greater$-Methylacetamide in Water},\n    journal = {The Journal of Physical Chemistry B}\n}\nfrom\ndoi2bib\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Webpage\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PDF\n    \n    \n    from Unpaywall"

Using computer simulations, we probe how different descriptions of the backbone glycyl unit affect the thermodynamics of insertion of individual residues, dipeptides, and entire transmembrane helices. Due to the lack of reference data, we first introduce an efficient methodology to estimate atomistic potential of mean force (PMF) curves from a series of representative and uncorrelated coarse-grained (CG) snapshots. We find strong discrepancies between two CG models, Martini and PLUM, against reference atomistic PMFs and experiments. Atomistic simulations suggest a weak free energy of insertion between water and a POPC membrane for the glycyl unit, in overall agreement with experimental results despite severe assumptions in our calculations. We show that refining the backbone contribution in PLUM significantly improves the PMF of insertion of the WALP16 transmembrane peptide. An improper balance between the glycyl backbone and the attached side chain will lead to energetic artifacts, rationalizing Martini’s overstabilization of WALP’s adsorbed interfacial state.

    "text": "AbstractTL;DRBibTeXOpen Access\n\n\nDiscrete-space kinetic models, i.e., Markov state models, have emerged as powerful tools for reducing the complexity of trajectories generated from molecular dynamics simulations. These models require configuration-space representations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics. Well-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this representation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to study conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary, applications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been scarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order parameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this work, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse configuration-space representation, using generic features of the solvation structure-the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the inherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the features as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting hidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most likely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are then used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately describes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model for glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the diffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide quantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they also reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the heterogeneity of local diffusion.\nfrom\nOrcid &\nCrossRef\n\n\n\nAn automated method is proposed for generating a coarse configuration-space representation, using generic features of the solvation structure-the coordination numbers about each particle, which accurately describes the diffusion kinetics of single-molecule diffusion processes.\nfrom\nSemantic Scholar\n\n\n\n@article{Rudzinski_2019,\n    doi = {10.1063/1.5064808},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1063%2F1.5064808},\n    year = 2019,\n    month = {jan},\n    publisher = {{AIP} Publishing},\n    volume = {150},\n    number = {2},\n    author = {Joseph F.

The present work provides a systematic investigation of the importance of higher-order multipoles on specific sites of halobenzenes, other than the halogen, for static and dynamic properties in condensed-phase simulations. For that purpose, solute-solvent interactions using point charge (PC), multipole (MTP), and hybrid point charge/multipole (HYB) electrostatic models are analyzed in regions of halogen bonding and extended to regions of π orbitals of phenyl carbons. Using molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical methods, it is found that the sigma-hole does not only affect the halogen and the carbon bound to it but its effect extends to the carbons adjacent to the CX bond. This effect increases with the magnitude of the positive potential of the sigma-hole. With the MTP and HYB3 models, all hydration free energies of the PhX compounds are reproduced within 0.1 kcal/mol. Analysis of pair distribution functions and hydration free energies of halogenated benzenes provides a microscopic explanation why “point charge”-based representations with off-site charges fail in reproducing thermodynamic properties of the sigma-hole.

In a medium throughput screen novel self‐assembling peptide (SAP) sequences that form fibrils and stimulated nerve fiber growth of peripheral nervous system (PNS)‐derived neurons are identified. Based on the peptide sequences and fibril morphologies and by applying rational data‐mining, important structural parameters stimulating neuronal activity are elucidated. Three SAPs (SAP1e, SAP2e, and SAP5c) enhance adhesion and growth of PNS neurons. These SAPs form 2D and 3D matrices that serve as bioactive scaffolds stimulating cell adhesion and growth. The newly discovered SAPs also support the growth of CNS neurons and glia cells. Subsequently, the potential of SAPs to enhance PNS regeneration in vivo is analyzed. For this, the facial nerve driving whisker movement in mice is injured. Notably, SAPs persist for up to 3 weeks in the injury site indicating highly adhesive properties and stability. After SAP administration, more motor neurons incorporating markers for successive regeneration are observed. Recovery of whisker movement is elevated in SAP‐injected mice.

Interestingly this basically recovers the celebrated Ferrenberg and Swendsen histogram reweighting formula, but from a Bayesian perspective!"

    "text": "Reweighting of nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics\nThis formalism can be extended to nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) dynamics. Moving from equilibrium thermodynamics to dynamics leads to the consideration of microtrajectories. Compared to microstates, their number quickly becomes intractable for all but the simplest of systems. For simplicity, we assume Markovian dynamics, so that we chop microtrajectories into bits that we can combine together. Effectively it converts an integral over a space-time trajectory into a sum \\[\n\\int {\\rm d}t \\, x(t) \\rightarrow \\sum_i x_i.\n\\]\nThe discretized version of the cross-entropy functional becomes \\[\n  \\mathcal{C} = - \\sum_{i,j} \\pi_i p_{ij} \\ln \\frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}},\n\\] which looks pretty familiar to the continuous case (1), but now uses the stationary distribution, \\(\\pi\\), and transition probability matrix elements, \\(p_{ij}\\), over a pre-defined lagtime.\nLet’s add some constraints!\nOk, so there are different types of constraints we could include, but here we’ll only deal with microscopic ones. If we were in equilibrium, we’d be working with detailed balance, \\(\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\pi_j p_{ji}\\). Detailed balance ensures there’s no net local flux. Out of equilbrium, we can still expect a balance constraint, but a weaker one–the famous Crooks fluctuation theorem.\n\nCrooks fluctuation theorem\nThe Crooks fluctuation theorem weighs the probability of observing a trajectory under an external driving force against its time-reversed analog. Let’s denote the probability of observing the time-forward trajectory by \\(\\mathcal{P}[\\Gamma(+t)|f(+t)]\\) and its time-reversed counterpart by \\(\\mathcal{P}[\\Gamma(-t)|f(-t)]\\). Crooks then tells us that \\[\n  \\frac{\\mathcal{P}[\\Gamma(+t)|f(+t)]}{\\mathcal{P}[\\Gamma(-t)|f(-t)]} = \\exp(-\\beta Q[\\Gamma(+t)|f(+t)]),\n\\] where \\(Q[\\Gamma(+t)|f(+t)]\\) refers to the amount of heat exchanged between the system and the reservoir. This equation can be integrated to yield the more familiar expression \\[\n\\langle \\Delta S_{ij}\\rangle = \\ln \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{ji}},\n\\tag{3}\n\\] where \\(\\Delta S_{ij}\\), the local entropy production, describes the amount of work an external reservoir has to perform on the system to transition between the two states \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). This expression generalizes detailed balance.\nThe expression for the local entropy production can be inserted as a constraint on the transition probability matrix elements to the cross-entropy functional (Eq. 2). We proposed such a functional in [Bause et al.][1], using such an approach for local balance, as well as a looser global balance constraint.\nThe resulting equation can be solved analytically, and its coefficients determined numerically by self-iteration.\n\n\nSeifert expression for the local entropy production\nOne exciting aspect of Eq. (3) is the possibility to determine \\(\\Delta S_{ij}\\). Thanks to Udo Seifert, we can determine the local entropy production of a microscopic trajectory, \\(\\Gamma(t)\\), itself \\[\n\\Delta S[\\Gamma(t)] = \\int {\\rm d}t \\, \\frac{\\bf{F}\\cdot \\bf{\\dot\\Gamma}}{T},\n\\tag{4}\n\\] where we integrate over time, \\(\\bf{\\dot\\Gamma}\\) is the velocity, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\nMarius Bause (first author in the paper) shows that the cross-entropy (aka Maximum Caliber) functional yields quantitative reweighting for overdamped Brownian dynamics. Here’s a comparison of reweighting in and out of equilibrium against direct simulations (take away: the points are on the top of the curves!):\n\nHis work leads to the formulation of an invariant. Just like the density of states, which does not change under change in temperature, this invariant does not depend on the driving force. It does, however, depend on the control variable (temperature of \\(\\Delta S\\))."

    "text": "Collective variables\nMarius’ follow-up work demonstrates the applicability of the method to larger systems by working with collective variables. The trick consists of replacing the potential energy that is hidden in Eq. (4) by a potential of mean force. In analogy, think of how structure-based coarse-graining goes from an atomistic potential energy surface to a smaller potential of mean force. The derivation of local entropy production in collective coordinates can be found in [Bause & Bereau][2]. It allowed Marius to perform quantitative non-equilibrium reweighting for a small peptide."
