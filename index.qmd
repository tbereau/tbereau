### Homepage of Tristan Bereau at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de), [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en)

I'm a computational physicist interested in the understanding and development of
multiscale modeling and machine learning methods for soft-condensed matter and biomolecules.
Research activities include

- Multiscale modeling for computational discovery and high-throughput screening
- Impact of coarse-graining on chemical-space exploration
- Physics-inspired machine learning for molecular systems

What's presented here is the concerted effort of many fantastic students,
postdocs, and collaborators I've had the chance to work with.

::: {.column width="79%"}

We're organizing the [Chemical Compound Space Conference 2024](https://ccsc2024.github.io/) to bring together the growing community dedicated to chemical-space exploration. Topics will include quantum-chemistry calculations, molecular simulations, and self-driving labs. The event will take place in beautiful Heidelberg on May 21-24, 2024. Register now on the website.
